A dynamic path planning visualisation system for mobile robots using Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi diagrams, and improved A*/D* Lite algorithms.  

## Features

- üó∫Ô∏è *Interactive Map Editor*: Draw obstacles (points/polygons) and set start/goal positions.  
- üìê *Delaunay/Voronoi Visualization*: Real-time rendering of triangulation and Voronoi edges.  
- üöÄ *Path Planning: Choose A (static) or D* Lite (dynamic) algorithms.  
- ‚ú® *Path Smoothing*: Optimise paths using Steiner points.  
- ‚ö° *Dynamic Obstacles*: Add/remove obstacles during runtime to test replanning.  

## Installation
